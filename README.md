# Covid-19 Testkits Delivery Bots
A simple AI planning (PDDL language) program I wrote for potential covid-19 testkits/vaccine delivery bots. 

How to run it:

# 1. Using online exiting planners
Clone the repo or copy paste the problem and planning code of this repo and upload to http://planning.domains/

# 2. Running on local machines
* Clone the repo and open it with VS studio
* Search for PDDL in the extension section and download the plugin
* Run directly with VS studio
